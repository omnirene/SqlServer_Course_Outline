SQL Server Course Outline

Chapter 1- Understanding the building blocks behind SqlServer

Lesson 1.1 – Understanding Databases
                • Learning objective – A theoretical introduction to understand: 
                    ◦ what a database is and why it is important. 
                    ◦ what is a Database Management System(DBMS).
                    ◦ what the Database Lifecycle(DBLC) entails. 
Lesson 1.2 – How to create reliable databases
                • Learning objective – Create and understand:
                    ◦ The steps one should follow to design a database (How to choose from the many data types and table constraints)
Lesson 1.3 – What is normalizaiton and why is it important to Databases?
                • Learning Objective – Understand what normalization is and how to implement the different normal forms. 
Lesson 1.4 – How to setup SqlServer and get your first script running:
                • Learning Objective – Steps to:
                    ◦ Download and setup SqlServer
                    ◦ How to get your first script running 

Chapter 2- The different forms of Normalization:

Lesson 2.1 – First normal form(1NF)
                • Learning objective – An introduction to understand: 
                    ◦ what the 1NF is
                    ◦ how to apply it to a scenario
Lesson 2.2 – Second normal form(2NF)
                • Learning objective – Understand:
                    ◦ What 2NF is
                    ◦ How is it different from 1NF
                    ◦ How to apply it to a scenario
Lesson 2.3 – Third normal form(3NF)
                • Learning Objective –Understand:
                    ◦ What 3NF is
                    ◦ How is it different from 2NF
                    ◦ How to apply it to a scenario

Chapter 3 – Understanding Data Definition Language(DDL)

Lesson 3.1 – What is DDL and why is it important
                • Learning objective – A small theoretical introduction to understand:
                    ◦ what DDL is and the different DDL commands to use on SqlServer.
Lesson 3.2 – Creating Databases and tables
                • Learning objective – A practical approach as to:
                    ◦ how to create a database and its tables in different normal forms. 
                    ◦ understand the different keys and constraints to use
Lesson 3.3 – Altering and Deleting tables
                • Learning objective – Understand the power of ‘Alter’ and ‘Delete’.
                    ◦ when to Alter or Delete the table
                    ◦ why you would want to Alter or Delete the table
                    ◦ how to Alter or Delete the tables

Chapter 4 – Understanding Data Manipulation Language(DML)

Lesson 4.1 – What is DML and why is it important
                • Learning objective – A theoretical understanding to:
                    ◦ what DML is
                    ◦ what the most common DML commands are. 
                    ◦ DDL vs DML
Lesson 4.2 – Create
                • Learning objective – Theoretical and practical understanding of:
                    ◦ how to insert or create records in the tables, considering the different datatypes
                    ◦ when to use it
Lesson 4.3 – Read
                • Learning objective – Understand:
                    ◦ how to read all or some values from the tables in a database
                    ◦ when to use it
Lesson 4.4 – Update and Delete
                • Learning objective – Understand:
                    ◦ how to update and Delete values in any table.
                    ◦ when to use it.
Lesson 4.5 – Putting it all together
                • Learning objective – Bringing all the knowledge together in a scenario to design and create a full database.

###I could add another lesson to teach Advanced DML commands, like Group By, but I was not sure as to whether that may be out of scope for this lessons.
