In this final exercise, we will attempt to test all of our knowledge so far. Creating databases and tables, performing CRUD functionality, and finally altering and deleting tables.

First, to do this, we must remember to create a rough model on a piece of paper before coding it directly. Have a look at this scenario below and give it your best shot!

Jane is a student about to start university. Before she goes in, the university needs to record her as a student so they capture her ID Number, first name, last name, age and gender. Once inputted, a student number is generated for her. The university that she belongs to has recorded her under a specific department. At any time, we record the department name, location and telephone number. Each department has an autogenerated unique identifier called DepartmentID. A department may have many students but Jane only belongs to one department.

Instructions

Create the Department table using the attributes given in the scenario above.

Create the Students table using the attibutes given above.

Alter the Students table to add the DepartmentID as a foreign key.

Jane is part of the Art department, so create an art department

Insert Jane Roca’s values into the database if her age was 18, gender was female and her ID was 9601214132090, (the DepartmentID must match).

Update Jane’s surname to Rocasan.

How would you go about deleting the tables in this database?
